        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1/2 cup powdered sugar</li>

    <h3>Instructions;</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Beat butter, 1/2 cup powdered sugar, and vanilla with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Gradually mix in flour, pecans, and salt until completely incorporated.
            Roll dough into walnut-sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bottoms are light golden brown but tops are still pale, 12 to 15 minutes. Try not to let cookies get too brown.
            <br>
            It's better to undercook them than to overcook them.</li>
        <li>Remove cookies from the oven and let sit on the baking sheets briefly before removing to wire racks.</li>
        <li>Place 1/3 cup powdered sugar in a shallow bowl; roll hot cookies in sugar to coat, then return to the wire racks to cool.
            <br>
            Once cooled, roll cookies in the powdered sugar once more.</li>
        </ol>
